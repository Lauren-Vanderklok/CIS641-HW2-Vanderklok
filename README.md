## Technical Background
Undergraduate in GV's computer science major. Entering the graduate program next semester. Previously worked at GHSP developing 
CAN networking testing software for GHSP shifters. As my programming knowledge relates to the project I will be working on this semester,.
I have used unity to make andriod apps before, but I have not spent alot of time on it since high school, and I have not worked
with unity in 2d before, so I will need some time to refresh my skills.
