## Technical Background
Undergraduate in GV's computer science major. Entering the graduate program next semester. Previously worked at GHSP developing 
CAN networking testing software for GHSP shifters. As my programming knowledge relates to the project I will be working on this semester,.
I have used unity to make andriod apps before, but I have not spent alot of time on it since high school, and I have not worked
with unity in 2d before, so I will need some time to refresh my skills.

## CIS 641 term project: Android Game
The end product will be a 2-D game running on Android devices. In the game, the explore a pixel art world, and collect object to advance into other sections of the world. By completing this project, I be more familiar with Unity, Android, C#, and designing user interfaces. Through this project I will gain experience teaching other people the Agile Scrum method of development, teaching people git and github, and common project management tasks such as generating requirements.
